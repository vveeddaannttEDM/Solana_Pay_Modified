# Solana Pay Modified

## Overview

Solana Pay Modified is a customized implementation of the Solana Pay protocol, designed to facilitate seamless and efficient transactions on the Solana blockchain. This project enhances the standard Solana Pay functionalities by introducing additional features and optimizations tailored for specific use cases.

## Features

- **Enhanced API Services**: The project includes `API_serv.js` and `updated_api.js`, which provide robust backend services for handling payment requests and processing transactions.

- **On-Chain Integration**: The `onchain_api.js` script enables direct interaction with Solana's on-chain programs, ensuring secure and swift transaction processing.

- **Data Management**: With `pay_data.js`, the system efficiently manages payment data, ensuring accuracy and consistency across transactions.

- **Rust-Based Smart Contracts**: The `sol_pay.rs` file contains smart contract logic written in Rust, leveraging Solana's high-performance capabilities for executing complex transaction workflows.
